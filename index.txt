77:T722,Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal risks.15:["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$77"}]

78:T652,As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is challenging due to the independent and inherently complex nature of technologies. Traditionally, regional analyses of technological portfolios have been limited to binary evaluations, indicating merely whether a region specializes in a technology, or relying on the average Technological Complexity Index (TCI) of the specialized technologies. This study proposes that evaluating TCI at the corporate level could provide finer granularity and more detailed insights. To address the underutilization of corporate-level TCI assessments in Japan, this study applies the Technological Complexity Index using carefully processed patent data spanning fiscal years 1981 to 2010. Specifically, we analyze a bipartite network composed of 1,938 corporations connected to technological fields categorized into either 35 or 124 classifications. Our findings quantitatively characterize the ubiquity and sophistication of each technological field, reveal detailed technological trends reflecting broader societal contexts, and demonstrate methodological stability even when employing finer technological classifications. Additionally, our corporate-level approach allows consistent comparisons across different regions and technological fields, clarifying regional advantages in specific technologies. This refined analytical framework offers policymakers and researchers robust, targeted insights, thereby significantly contributing to innovation strategy formulation in Japan.1a:["$","section","2025-07-15",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-15","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-15"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Technological Complexity Based on Japanese Patent Data"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Rintaro Karashima, Hiroyasu Inoue"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-16T10:12:00Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932v4","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932v4"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$78"}]]}]]}]]}]

79:T749,The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.1e:["$","section","2025-07-11",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-11","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-11"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Can Large Language Models Understand As Well As Apply Patent Regulations\n  to Pass a Hands-On Patent Attorney Test?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Bhakti Khera, Rezvan Alamian, Pascal A.

7a:T4da,This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true'' green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking in different domains.26:["$","section","2025-07-03",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-03","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-03"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns\n  from Green Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lapo Santarlasci, Armando Rungi, Antonio Zinilli"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-03T03:51:33Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$7a"}]]}]]}]]}]

7b:T60c,In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level. The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336 full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments (forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional, requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now the access link is this repository: https://osf.io/vbyzd/?view_only=1a40242e0d1941a58aa854af3e50cf6b).7c:T428,Recent advances in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative capabilities across diverse domains. The field of patent analysis and innovation is not an exception, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques presents opportunities to streamline and enhance important tasks -- such as patent classification and patent retrieval -- in the patent cycle. This not only accelerates the efficiency of patent researchers and applicants, but also opens new avenues for technological innovation and discovery. Our survey provides a comprehensive summary of recent NLP-based methods -- including multimodal ones -- in patent analysis. We also introduce a novel taxonomy for categorization based on tasks in the patent life cycle, as well as the specifics of the methods. This interdisciplinary survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners who work at the intersection of NLP, Multimodal AI, and patent analysis, as well as patent offices to build efficient patent systems.2c:["$","section","2025-06-27",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-27","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-27"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"DAPFAM: A Domain-Aware Patent Retrieval Dataset Aggregated at the Family\n  Level"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Iliass Ayaou, Denis Cavallucci, Hicham Chibane"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-06-27T11:34:51Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$7b"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"A Survey on Patent Analysis: From NLP to Multimodal AI"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Homaira Huda Shomee, Zhu Wang, Sathya N.

7d:T529,Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.7e:T4e9,Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination.

7f:T610,Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.80:T490,Papers, patents, and clinical trials are essential scientific resources in biomedicine, crucial for knowledge sharing and dissemination. However, these documents are often stored in disparate databases with varying management standards and data formats, making it challenging to form systematic and fine-grained connections among them. To address this issue, we construct PKG 2.0, a comprehensive knowledge graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48 million clinical trials in the biomedical field. PKG 2.0 integrates these dispersed resources through 482 million biomedical entity linkages, 19 million citation linkages, and 7 million project linkages. The construction of PKG 2.0 wove together fine-grained biomedical entity extraction, high-performance author name disambiguation, multi-source citation integration, and high-quality project data from the NIH Exporter. Data validation demonstrates that PKG 2.0 excels in key tasks such as author disambiguation and biomedical entity recognition. This dataset provides valuable resources for biomedical researchers, bibliometric scholars, and those engaged in literature mining.35:["$","section","2025-06-18",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-18","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-18"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PEDANTIC: A Dataset for the Automatic Examination of Definiteness in\n  Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Valentin Knappich, Annemarie Friedrich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-27T15:34:39Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21342v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21342v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$7f"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PubMed knowledge graph 2.0: Connecting papers, patents, and clinical\n  trials in biomedical science"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Jian Xu, Chao Yu, Jiawei Xu, Vetle I.

81:T57d,Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which complicates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.39:["$","section","2025-06-14",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-14","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-14"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"A Hybrid Architecture with Efficient Fine Tuning for Abstractive Patent\n  Document Summarization"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Nevidu Jayatilleke, Ruvan Weerasinghe"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-03-13T13:30:54Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10354v4","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10354v4"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$81"}]]}]]}]]}]

82:T627,Recent copyright agreements between AI companies and content creators underscore the need for fine-grained control over language models' ability to reproduce copyrighted text. Existing defenses-ranging from aggressive unlearning to simplistic output filters-either sacrifice model utility or inadequately address verbatim leakage. We introduce Obliviate, a lightweight post-training method that surgically suppresses exact reproduction of specified sequences while preserving semantic understanding. Obliviate first identifies memorized passages and then, for each target token, minimally adjusts the model's output distribution via a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to drive down the probability of exact reproduction. Simultaneously, we enforce a consistency loss on non-target tokens to retain the model's fluency and task performance. We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models (LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic memorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings, Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at most 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande. Furthermore, we benchmark Obliviate aganist different unlearning and copyright techniques using the MUSE and CoTaEval benchmarks. These results position Obliviate as a practical, high-fidelity solution for copyright compliance in deployed LLMs.3b:["$","section","2025-06-12",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-12","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-12"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Obliviate: Efficient Unmemorization for Protecting Intellectual Property\n  in Large Language Models"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-02-20T20:02:56Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15010v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15010v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$82"}]]}]]}]]}]

83:T468,The protection of cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with online retrieval capabilities enables convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources, which will significantly reduce the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and lead to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response, we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction and redistribution by leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs, outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.41:["$","section","2025-06-06",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-06","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-06"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Web Intellectual Property at Risk: Preventing Unauthorized Real-Time\n  Retrieval by Large Language Models"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yisheng Zhong, Yizhu Wen, Junfeng Guo, Mehran Kafai, Heng Huang, Hanqing Guo, Zhuangdi Zhu"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-19T03:14:08Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$83"}]]}]]}]]}]

84:T465,Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.46:["$","section","2025-06-01",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-01","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-01"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PreGIP: Watermarking the Pretraining of Graph Neural Networks for Deep\n  Intellectual Property Protection"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Enyan Dai, Minhua Lin, Suhang Wang"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-02-06T22:13:49Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04435v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04435v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$84"}]]}]]}]]}]
85:T68f,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

87:T585,Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word, sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency improvement and technology relevance mining.4b:["$","section","2025-05-27",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-27","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-27"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Research on feature fusion and multimodal patent text based on graph\n  attention network"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Zhenzhen Song, Ziwei Liu, Hongji Li"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-26T16:32:43Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$87"}]]}]]}]]}]
88:T493,Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature, application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods for analyzing patent similarity.89:T5be,Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.4c:["$","section","2025-05-26",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-26","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-26"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentMind: A Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph for Patent Similarity\n  Evaluation"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:28:27Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$88"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:20:11Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$89"}]]}],"$L8a","$L8b"]}]]}]

8c:T5c4,Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions, and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2) Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future research.53:["$","section","2025-05-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Enriching Patent Claim Generation with European Patent Dataset"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Chengzu Li, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-18T23:04:49Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$8c"}]]}]]}]]}]

8d:T4f7,Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.56:["$","section","2025-05-16",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-16","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-16"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Towards Better Evaluation for Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-16T10:27:16Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11095v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11095v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$8d"}]]}]]}]]}]

On one hand, formal statutes (\"law on the books\") set the scope of what can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other hand, actual enforcement (\"law in practice\") determines whether those rights hold up in practice. To capture these dimensions, researchers have developed simple indices of legal provisions and more nuanced proxies for enforcement effectiveness, along with metrics of how applicant-friendly each office's procedures are. Comparative studies of \"twin patents\" -- identical inventions filed in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic differences in grant rates and bar heights across major offices. By combining these approaches, we gain a multifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances statutory design, administrative practice, and actual enforcement.

8e:T4e7,Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the fingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that fingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and KL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high data utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\% detection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.5c:["$","section","2025-05-10",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-10","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-10"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"NCorr-FP: A Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting\n  Scheme for Intellectual Property Protection of Structured Data"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Tanja Šarčević, Andreas Rauber, Rudolf Mayer"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-09T18:53:27Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$8e"}]]}]]}]]}]

8f:T6ce,Abundant and diverse data on medicines manufacturing and other lifecycle components has been made easily accessible in the last decades. However, a significant proportion of this information is characterised by not being tabulated and usable for machine learning purposes. Thus, natural language processing tools have been used to build databases in domains such as biomedical and chemical to address this limitation. This has allowed the development of artificial intelligence applications, which have improved drug discovery and treatments. In the pharmaceutical manufacturing context, some initiatives and datasets for primary processing can be found, but the manufacturing of drug products is an area which is still lacking, to the best of our knowledge. This works aims to explore and adapt NLP tools used in other domains to extract information on both primary and secondary manufacturing, employing patents as the main source of data. Thus, two independent, but complementary, models were developed comprising a method to select fragments of text that contain manufacturing data, and a named entity recognition system that enables extracting information on operations, materials, and conditions of a process. For the first model, the identification of relevant sections was achieved using an unsupervised approach combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation and k-Means clustering. The performance of this model measured as a Cohen's kappa between model output and manual revision was higher than 90%. NER model consisted of a deep neural network, and an f1-score micro average of 84.2% was obtained which is comparable to other works. Some considerations for these tools to be used in data extraction are discussed throughout this document.65:["$","section","2025-05-01",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-01","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-01"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Natural Language Processing tools for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n  Information Extraction from Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Diego Alvarado-Maldonado, Blair Johnston, Cameron J.

However, the application of LLMs in the patent domain remains under-explored and under-developed due to the complexity of patents, particularly their language and legal framework. Understanding the unique characteristics of patent documents and related research in the patent domain becomes essential for researchers to apply these tools effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to equip NLP researchers with the essential knowledge to navigate this complex domain efficiently. We introduce the relevant fundamental aspects of patents to provide solid background information. In addition, we systematically break down the structural and linguistic characteristics unique to patents and map out how NLP can be leveraged for patent analysis and generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the spectrum of text-based and multimodal patent-related tasks, including nine patent analysis and four patent generation tasks.6c:["$","section","2025-04-24",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-24","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-24"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Natural Language Processing in the Patent Domain: A Survey"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-03-06T23:17:16Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04105v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04105v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$90"}]]}]]}]]}]

91:T509,Intellectual Property (IP) is a unique domain that integrates technical and legal knowledge, making it inherently complex and knowledge-intensive. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, they show great potential for processing IP tasks, enabling more efficient analysis, understanding, and generation of IP-related content. However, existing datasets and benchmarks either focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large, diverse bilingual benchmark, IPBench, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 tasks. This benchmark is designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world intellectual property applications, encompassing both understanding and generation. We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of IPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to better reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.6e:["$","section","2025-04-22",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-22","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-22"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"IPBench: Benchmarking the Knowledge of Large Language Models in\n  Intellectual Property"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Qiyao Wang, Guhong Chen, Hongbo Wang, Huaren Liu, Minghui Zhu, Zhifei Qin, Linwei Li, Yilin Yue, Shiqiang Wang, Jiayan Li, Yihang Wu, Ziqiang Liu, Longze Chen, Run Luo, Liyang Fan, Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Kan Xu, Hongfei Lin, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Shiwen Ni, Yuan Lin, Min Yang"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-22T02:00:41Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15524v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15524v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$91"}]]}]]}]]}]
92:T60d,Intellectual Property (IP) management involves strategically protecting and utilizing intellectual assets to enhance organizational innovation, competitiveness, and value creation. Patent matching is a crucial task in intellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and utilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents directly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and overlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of patents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent matching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from their parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their memory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing these entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph, we utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM in comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the PatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a 17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis highlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both in-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning processes of LLMs during patent matching.

93:T42c,This article examines the proportion of technical knowledge that is eventually patented and discusses implications for innovation. Drawing from economic theory and information science, the study considers a continuum from raw data to applied understanding, while distinguishing between patentable inventions and other types of knowledge. The article explains that although the patent system is designed to incentivize the creation of economically valuable technology, only a small fraction of patentable inventions receive patent protection. Empirical evidence from surveys and historical data reveal that patenting remains an exception rather than a rule in many, but not all, industries. Furthermore, the article explores the trade-offs inherent in public disclosure requirements in patent law, which facilitate knowledge dissemination and may aid competitors. In doing so, it highlights the critical balance between rewarding inventors and preserving the free flow of knowledge, ultimately underscoring the complex role patents play in modern innovation ecosystems.74:["$","section","2025-04-16",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-16","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-16"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"The Role of Patents: Incentivizing Innovation or Hindering Progress?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Gaetan de Rassenfosse"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-12-18T22:08:29Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14370v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14370v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"This article examines the complex trade-offs inherent in the patent system, exploring whether patents truly incentivize innovation or inadvertently hinder progress.

96:T58c,This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.8a:["$","div","2",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-12-03T16:43:42Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$96"}]]}]
97:T4b8,Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various text generation tasks but remain under-explored in the patent domain, which offers highly structured and precise language. This paper constructs a dataset to investigate the performance of current LLMs in patent claim generation. Our results demonstrate that generating claims based on patent descriptions outperforms previous research relying on abstracts. Interestingly, current patent-specific LLMs perform much worse than state-of-the-art general LLMs, highlighting the necessity for future research on in-domain LLMs. We also find that LLMs can produce high-quality first independent claims, but their performances markedly decrease for subsequent dependent claims. Moreover, fine-tuning can enhance the completeness of inventions' features, conceptual clarity, and feature linkage. Among the tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrates the best performance in comprehensive human evaluations by patent experts, with better feature coverage, conceptual clarity, and technical coherence. Despite these capabilities, comprehensive revision and modification are still necessary to pass rigorous patent scrutiny and ensure legal robustness.8b:["$","div","3",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Can Large Language Models Generate High-quality Patent Claims?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Caiqi Zhang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-06-27T18:07:40Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$97"}]]}]

98:T444,Patent quality is a critical yet complex concept of interest to inventors, legal experts, and policymakers alike. This article demystifies patent quality by examining its various dimensions and definitions. It begins by discussing invention quality, emphasizing that the notion of 'technological superiority' is often too abstract to capture practical impact. The work distinguishes between incremental and radical innovations, highlighting that inventions can be evaluated by improvements over previous technologies and their economic potential. Four definitions of patent quality are explored: one based on invention quality, another linking quality with economic value, a third focusing on drafting clarity, and a fourth measuring compliance with legal standards. The article explains that high-quality patents may not necessarily protect valuable inventions and that weak patents can hold significant economic value due to legal advantages. This accessible review provides a comprehensive framework that benefits a broad audience interested in innovation policy and intellectual property.95:["$","div","3",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"What is patent quality?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Gaetan de Rassenfosse"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-05T21:11:04Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08785v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08785v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$98"}]]}]
