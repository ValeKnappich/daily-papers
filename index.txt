142:T5a4,The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic systems that perform autonomous reasoning and tool use has created significant intellectual property (IP) value. We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility.14:["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$142"}]

143:T777,Key doctrines, including novelty (patent), originality (copyright), and distinctiveness (trademark), turn on a shared empirical question: whether a body of work is meaningfully distinct from a relevant reference class. Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.22:["$","section","2026-01-27",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2026-01-27","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2026-01-27"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: A Distributional Test of Distinctiveness for Machine-Generated Works in Intellectual Property Law"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Anirban Mukherjee, Hannah Hanwen Chang"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2026-01-26T05:20:33Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18156v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18156v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$143"}]]}]]}]]}]

144:T408,The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.2f:["$","section","2026-01-14",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2026-01-14","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2026-01-14"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Zhenhua Xu, Yiran Zhao, Mengting Zhong, Dezhang Kong, Changting Lin, Tong Qiao, Meng Han"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2026-01-13T05:05:37Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$144"}]]}]]}]]}]

145:T595,The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO adjudicates thousands of ex parte appeals each year, requiring the integration of technical understanding and legal reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

146:T4b4,We leverage multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a dataset of 306,070 German patents (1877-1918) from 9,562 archival image scans using our LLM-based pipeline powered by Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite. Our benchmarking exercise provides tentative evidence that multimodal LLMs can create higher quality datasets than our research assistants, while also being more than 795 times faster and 205 times cheaper in constructing the patent dataset from our image corpus. About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools, lowering the barriers for less technical researchers. Finally, we explain the economics of deploying LLMs for historical dataset construction and conclude by speculating on the potential implications for the field of economic history.147:T526,Artificial intelligence has become a key arena of global technological competition and a central concern for Europe's quest for technological sovereignty. This paper analyzes global AI patenting from 2010 to 2023 to assess Europe's position in an increasingly bipolar innovation landscape dominated by the United States and China. Using linked patent, firm, ownership, and citation data, we examine the geography, specialization, and international diffusion of AI innovation. We find a highly concentrated patent landscape: China leads in patent volumes, while the United States dominates in citation impact and technological influence. Europe accounts for a limited share of AI patents but exhibits signals of relatively high patent quality. Technological proximity reveals global convergence toward U.S. innovation trajectories, with Europe remaining fragmented rather than forming an autonomous pole. Gravity-model estimates show that cross-border AI knowledge flows are driven primarily by technological capability and specialization, while geographic and institutional factors play a secondary role. EU membership does not significantly enhance intra-European knowledge diffusion, suggesting that technological capacity, rather than political integration, underpins participation in global AI innovation networks.45:["$","section","2025-12-23",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-12-23","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-12-23"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Multimodal LLMs for Historical Dataset Construction from Archival Image Scans: German Patents (1877-1918)"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Niclas Griesshaber, Jochen Streb"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-12-22T18:53:03Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19675v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19675v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$146"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Owning the Intelligence: Global AI Patents Landscape and Europe's Quest for Technological Sovereignty"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lapo Santarlasci, Armando Rungi, Loredana Fattorini, Nestor Maslej"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-12-22T16:52:36Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19569v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19569v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$147"}]]}]]}]]}]

148:T73a,The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical.49:["$","section","2025-12-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-12-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-12-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Protecting Deep Neural Network Intellectual Property with Chaos-Based White-Box Watermarking"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Sangeeth B, Serena Nicolazzo, Deepa K., Vinod P"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-12-18T15:26:50Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16658v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$148"}]]}]]}]]}]

149:T4fb,In this work, we present web scraping techniques to extract in- formation from patent tables, clean and structure them for future use in predictive machine learning models to develop new glasses. We extracted compositions and three properties relevant to the development of new glasses and structured them into a database to be used together with information from other available datasets. We also analyzed the consistency of the information obtained and what it adds to the existing databases. The extracted liquidus temperatures comprise 5,696 compositions; the second subset includes 4,298 refractive indexes and, finally, 1,771 compositions with Abbe numbers. The extraction performed here increases the available information by approximately 10.4% for liquidus temperature, 6.6% for refractive index, and 4.9% for Abbe number. The impact extends beyond quantity: the newly extracted data introduce compositions with property values that are more diverse than those in existing databases, thereby expanding the accessible compositional and property space for glass modeling applications. We emphasize that the compositions of the new database contain relatively more titanium, magnesium, zirconium, niobium, iron, tin, and yttrium oxides than those of the existing bases.64:["$","section","2025-11-21",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-11-21","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-11-21"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"From Patents to Dataset: Scraping for Oxide Glass Compositions and Properties"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Gustavo Laranja Thomaello, Thomaz Yeiden Busnardo Aguena, Eric Trevelato Costa, Rafael Baságlia Rosante, Thiago Rodrigo Ramos, Daiane Aparecida Zuanetti, Edgar Dutra Zanotto"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-11-20T13:51:24Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16366v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16366v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$149"}]]}]]}]]}]

14a:T547,Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools, systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools. Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\% respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.7a:["$","section","2025-10-30",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-30","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-30"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A\n  Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yuqian Chai, Chaochao Wang, Weilei Wang"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-10-29T11:20:18Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$14a"}]]}]]}]]}]

14b:T5db,As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality. Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

14c:T576,Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.82:["$","section","2025-10-22",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-22","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-22"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patent Language Model Pretraining with ModernBERT"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Amirhossein Yousefiramandi, Ciaran Cooney"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-09-18T13:04:30Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14926v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14926v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$14c"}]]}]]}]]}]
14d:T40a,This review systematically analyzes patent disclosures regarding plasmonic structures, devices, and integrated applications, highlighting the technology's capability to confine and manipulate electromagnetic energy at the nanoscale. Core materials rely on highly conductive noble metals (Gold, Silver), alongside innovative alternatives like Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs), Graphene, and 2D materials. These materials are engineered into diverse nanostructures that exploit Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). LSPR generates intense electromagnetic "hot spots" necessary for signal amplification (SERS) and provides extreme refractive index sensitivity for label-free detection. Key device elements include subwavelength plasmonic waveguides (hybrid and slot types) for optical signal routing. Dynamic control is achieved through active tuning mechanisms, utilizing electrical gating of charge carrier density (e.g., TCOs, Graphene) and solid-state phase change materials (e.g., VO2).83:["$","section","2025-10-21",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-21","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-21"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Plasmonic Structures, Devices, and Integrated Applications A Patent\n  Analysis"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Mahdi Javidnasab, Sajjad Hosseinzade"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-10-20T13:41:45Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17537v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17537v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$14d"}]]}]]}]]}]

14e:T4da,This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true'' green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking in different domains.87:["$","section","2025-10-17",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-17","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-17"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns\n  from Green Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lapo Santarlasci, Armando Rungi, Antonio Zinilli"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-03T03:51:33Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$14e"}]]}]]}]]}]

14f:T58c,Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.8a:["$","section","2025-10-14",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-14","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-14"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Self-Filtered Distillation with LLMs-generated Trust Indicators for\n  Reliable Patent Classification"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Xu Zhang, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-10-06T22:50:01Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05431v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05431v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$14f"}]]}]]}]]}]

150:T569,Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which offers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce hierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1) Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2) Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4) Applicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which highlights its broad applicability.8f:["$","section","2025-10-09",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-10-09","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-10-09"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Reasoning for Hierarchical Text Classification: The Case of Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Wenjun Sun, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-10-08T16:06:04Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07167v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07167v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$150"}]]}]]}]]}]

151:T576,Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.a3:["$","section","2025-09-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-09-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-09-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patent Language Model Pretraining with ModernBERT"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Amirhossein Yousefiramandi, Ciaran Cooney"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-09-18T13:04:30Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14926v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14926v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$151"}]]}]]}]]}]

152:T4f4,High-stakes texts such as patent claims, medical records, and technical reports are structurally complex and demand a high degree of reliability and precision. While large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to automate their generation in high-stakes domains, reliably evaluating such outputs remains a major challenge. Conventional natural language generation (NLG) metrics are effective for generic documents but fail to capture the structural and legal characteristics essential to evaluating complex high-stakes documents. To address this gap, we propose PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework specifically designed for one of the most intricate and rigorous domains, patent claims. PatentScore integrates hierarchical decomposition of claim elements, validation patterns grounded in legal and technical standards, and scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. In experiments on our dataset which consists of 400 Claim1, PatentScore achieved the highest correlation with expert annotations ($r = 0.819$), significantly outperforming widely used NLG metrics. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating LLM-generated patent claims, providing a solid foundation for research on patent generation and validation.a5:["$","section","2025-09-17",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-09-17","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-09-17"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:20:11Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$152"}]]}]]}]]}]

153:T749,The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.aa:["$","section","2025-09-12",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-09-12","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-09-12"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Can Large Language Models Understand As Well As Apply Patent Regulations\n  to Pass a Hands-On Patent Attorney Test?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Bhakti Khera, Rezvan Alamian, Pascal A.

157:T75c,Graph-structured data, which captures non-Euclidean relationships and interactions between entities, is growing in scale and complexity. As a result, training state-of-the-art graph machine learning (GML) models have become increasingly resource-intensive, turning these models and data into invaluable Intellectual Property (IP). To address the resource-intensive nature of model training, graph-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (GMLaaS) has emerged as an efficient solution by leveraging third-party cloud services for model development and management. However, deploying such models in GMLaaS also exposes them to potential threats from attackers. Specifically, while the APIs within a GMLaaS system provide interfaces for users to query the model and receive outputs, they also allow attackers to exploit and steal model functionalities or sensitive training data, posing severe threats to the safety of these GML models and the underlying graph data. To address these challenges, this survey systematically introduces the first taxonomy of threats and defenses at the level of both GML model and graph-structured data. Such a tailored taxonomy facilitates an in-depth understanding of GML IP protection. Furthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of IP protection methods, introduce a curated set of benchmark datasets across various domains, and discuss their application scopes and future challenges. Finally, we establish an open-sourced versatile library named PyGIP, which evaluates various attack and defense techniques in GMLaaS scenarios and facilitates the implementation of existing benchmark methods. The library resource can be accessed at: https://labrai.github.io/PyGIP. We believe this survey will play a fundamental role in intellectual property protection for GML and provide practical recipes for the GML community.b9:["$","section","2025-08-28",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-08-28","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-08-28"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Intellectual Property in Graph-Based Machine Learning as a Service:\n  Attacks and Defenses"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lincan Li, Bolin Shen, Chenxi Zhao, Yuxiang Sun, Kaixiang Zhao, Shirui Pan, Yushun Dong"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-08-27T07:37:52Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19641v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19641v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$157"}]]}]]}]]}]

158:T628,In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data. However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

159:T49a,Finding relevant prior art is crucial when deciding whether to file a new patent application or invalidate an existing patent. However, searching for prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval quality and computational efficiency.c6:["$","section","2025-08-15",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-08-15","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-08-15"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Efficient Patent Searching Using Graph Transformers"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Krzysztof Daniell, Igor Buzhinsky, Sebastian Björkqvist"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-08-14T09:53:26Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10496v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10496v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$159"}]]}]]}]]}]

15a:T713,Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.d2:["$","section","2025-08-03",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-08-03","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-08-03"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in\n  Routing-based Model Merging"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Xin He, Junxi Shen, Zhenheng Tang, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li, Ivor W.

15b:T4e0,Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and future research.d6:["$","section","2025-07-30",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-30","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-30"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Homaira Huda Shomee, Suman Kalyan Maity, Sourav Medya"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-30T05:17:35Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$15b"}]]}]]}]]}]

15c:T6ac,This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming, manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning, and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances decision making in complex R&D environments.d9:["$","section","2025-07-27",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-27","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-27"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Artificial Intelligence In Patent And Market Intelligence: A New\n  Paradigm For Technology Scouting"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Manish Verma, Vivek Sharma, Vishal Singh"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-27T15:22:39Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20322v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20322v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$15c"}]]}]]}]]}]

15d:T5a4,This study investigates the relationship between innovation activities and firm-level productivity among early-stage high-tech startups in China. Using a proprietary dataset encompassing patent records, R&D expenditures, capital valuation, and firm performance from 2020 to 2024, we examine whether and how innovation, measured by patents and R&D input, translates into economic output. Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms. Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true innovative productivity. In contrast, R&D expenditure shows a consistent and positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we explore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and policy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&D, identifying capital inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&D investment. Finally, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effects of R&D are more pronounced in sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms based in Shenzhen. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that patent output is a universal indicator of innovation success and underscore the context-dependent nature of innovation-performance linkages in emerging markets.dc:["$","section","2025-07-24",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-24","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-24"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Beyond Patents: R&D, Capital, and the Productivity Puzzle in Early-Stage\n  High-Tech Firms"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Victor, CHEN"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-24T09:19:22Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18227v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18227v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$15d"}]]}]]}]]}]

15e:T722,Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal risks.e0:["$","section","2025-07-20",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-20","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-20"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"FullRecall: A Semantic Search-Based Ranking Approach for Maximizing\n  Recall in Patent Retrieval"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Amna Ali, Liyanage C.

15f:T5fe,In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation. This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science, by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents, and international competition with patents, this work considers how new technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality, implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems. Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to access equity in innovation.e1:["$","section","2025-07-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patents as Knowledge Artifacts: An Information Science Perspective on\n  Global Innovation"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","M.

160:T652,As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is challenging due to the independent and inherently complex nature of technologies. Traditionally, regional analyses of technological portfolios have been limited to binary evaluations, indicating merely whether a region specializes in a technology, or relying on the average Technological Complexity Index (TCI) of the specialized technologies. This study proposes that evaluating TCI at the corporate level could provide finer granularity and more detailed insights. To address the underutilization of corporate-level TCI assessments in Japan, this study applies the Technological Complexity Index using carefully processed patent data spanning fiscal years 1981 to 2010. Specifically, we analyze a bipartite network composed of 1,938 corporations connected to technological fields categorized into either 35 or 124 classifications. Our findings quantitatively characterize the ubiquity and sophistication of each technological field, reveal detailed technological trends reflecting broader societal contexts, and demonstrate methodological stability even when employing finer technological classifications. Additionally, our corporate-level approach allows consistent comparisons across different regions and technological fields, clarifying regional advantages in specific technologies. This refined analytical framework offers policymakers and researchers robust, targeted insights, thereby significantly contributing to innovation strategy formulation in Japan.e5:["$","section","2025-07-15",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-15","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-15"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Technological Complexity Based on Japanese Patent Data"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Rintaro Karashima, Hiroyasu Inoue"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-16T10:12:00Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932v4","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932v4"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$160"}]]}]]}]]}]

161:T749,The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney.

162:T4da,This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true'' green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking in different domains.f1:["$","section","2025-07-03",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-07-03","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-07-03"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns\n  from Green Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lapo Santarlasci, Armando Rungi, Antonio Zinilli"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-07-03T03:51:33Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$162"}]]}]]}]]}]

163:T60c,In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level. The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336 full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments (forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional, requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now the access link is this repository: https://osf.io/vbyzd/?view_only=1a40242e0d1941a58aa854af3e50cf6b).164:T428,Recent advances in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative capabilities across diverse domains. The field of patent analysis and innovation is not an exception, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques presents opportunities to streamline and enhance important tasks -- such as patent classification and patent retrieval -- in the patent cycle. This not only accelerates the efficiency of patent researchers and applicants, but also opens new avenues for technological innovation and discovery. Our survey provides a comprehensive summary of recent NLP-based methods -- including multimodal ones -- in patent analysis. We also introduce a novel taxonomy for categorization based on tasks in the patent life cycle, as well as the specifics of the methods. This interdisciplinary survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners who work at the intersection of NLP, Multimodal AI, and patent analysis, as well as patent offices to build efficient patent systems.f7:["$","section","2025-06-27",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-27","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-27"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"DAPFAM: A Domain-Aware Patent Retrieval Dataset Aggregated at the Family\n  Level"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Iliass Ayaou, Denis Cavallucci, Hicham Chibane"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-06-27T11:34:51Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$163"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"A Survey on Patent Analysis: From NLP to Multimodal AI"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Homaira Huda Shomee, Zhu Wang, Sathya N.

165:T529,Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.ff:["$","section","2025-06-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Hierarchical Multi-Positive Contrastive Learning for Patent Image\n  Retrieval"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Kshitij Kavimandan, Angelos Nalmpantis, Emma Beauxis-Aussalet, Robert-Jan Sips"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-06-16T13:53:02Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13496v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13496v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$165"}]]}]]}]]}]
166:T4e9,Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.167:T610,Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.

169:T57d,Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which complicates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.104:["$","section","2025-06-14",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-14","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-14"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"A Hybrid Architecture with Efficient Fine Tuning for Abstractive Patent\n  Document Summarization"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Nevidu Jayatilleke, Ruvan Weerasinghe"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-03-13T13:30:54Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10354v4","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10354v4"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$169"}]]}]]}]]}]

16a:T627,Recent copyright agreements between AI companies and content creators underscore the need for fine-grained control over language models' ability to reproduce copyrighted text. Existing defenses-ranging from aggressive unlearning to simplistic output filters-either sacrifice model utility or inadequately address verbatim leakage. We introduce Obliviate, a lightweight post-training method that surgically suppresses exact reproduction of specified sequences while preserving semantic understanding. Obliviate first identifies memorized passages and then, for each target token, minimally adjusts the model's output distribution via a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to drive down the probability of exact reproduction. Simultaneously, we enforce a consistency loss on non-target tokens to retain the model's fluency and task performance. We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models (LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic memorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings, Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at most 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande. Furthermore, we benchmark Obliviate aganist different unlearning and copyright techniques using the MUSE and CoTaEval benchmarks. These results position Obliviate as a practical, high-fidelity solution for copyright compliance in deployed LLMs.106:["$","section","2025-06-12",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-12","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-12"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Obliviate: Efficient Unmemorization for Protecting Intellectual Property\n  in Large Language Models"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-02-20T20:02:56Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15010v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15010v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$16a"}]]}]]}]]}]

16b:T468,The protection of cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with online retrieval capabilities enables convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources, which will significantly reduce the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and lead to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response, we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction and redistribution by leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs, outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.10c:["$","section","2025-06-06",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-06-06","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-06-06"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Web Intellectual Property at Risk: Preventing Unauthorized Real-Time\n  Retrieval by Large Language Models"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yisheng Zhong, Yizhu Wen, Junfeng Guo, Mehran Kafai, Heng Huang, Hanqing Guo, Zhuangdi Zhu"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-19T03:14:08Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12655v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$16b"}]]}]]}]]}]

16c:T465,Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.16d:T68f,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

16f:T585,Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word, sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency improvement and technology relevance mining.170:T493,Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature, application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods for analyzing patent similarity.117:["$","section","2025-05-26",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-26","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-26"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Research on feature fusion and multimodal patent text based on graph\n  attention network"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Zhenzhen Song, Ziwei Liu, Hongji Li"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-26T16:32:43Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$16f"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentMind: A Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph for Patent Similarity\n  Evaluation"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:28:27Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$170"}]]}],"$L171","$L172","$L173"]}]]}]

174:T466,Scientific knowledge is a key driver of technological innovation, shaping industrial development and policy decisions worldwide. Understanding how patents incorporate scientific research is essential for assessing the role of academic discoveries in technological progress. Non-Patent References (NPRs) provide a useful indicator of this relationship by revealing the extent to which patents draw upon scientific literature. Here, we show that reliance on scientific research in patents varies significantly across regions. Oceania and Europe display stronger engagement with scientific knowledge, while the Americas exhibit lower reliance. Moreover, NPRs are more likely to be open access than the average scientific publication, a trend that intensifies when Sci-Hub availability is considered. These results highlight the transformative impact of Open Science on global innovation dynamics. By facilitating broader access to research, Open Science strengthens the link between academia and industry, underscoring the need for policies that promote equitable and science-based innovation, particularly in developing regions.11c:["$","section","2025-05-21",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-21","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-21"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Open Science, Open Innovation?

175:T5c4,Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions, and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2) Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future research.11e:["$","section","2025-05-19",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-19","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-19"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Enriching Patent Claim Generation with European Patent Dataset"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Chengzu Li, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-18T23:04:49Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12568v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$175"}]]}]]}]]}]

176:T4f7,Patent claims define the scope of protection and establish the legal boundaries of an invention. Drafting these claims is a complex and time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To solve these challenges, researchers have investigated the use of large language models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims. Our experiments demonstrate that PatClaimEval achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations across all assessment criteria among all tested metrics. This research provides the groundwork for more accurate evaluations of automated patent claim generation systems.121:["$","section","2025-05-16",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-16","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-16"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Towards Better Evaluation for Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-16T10:27:16Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11095v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11095v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$176"}]]}]]}]]}]

On one hand, formal statutes (\"law on the books\") set the scope of what can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other hand, actual enforcement (\"law in practice\") determines whether those rights hold up in practice. To capture these dimensions, researchers have developed simple indices of legal provisions and more nuanced proxies for enforcement effectiveness, along with metrics of how applicant-friendly each office's procedures are. Comparative studies of \"twin patents\" -- identical inventions filed in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic differences in grant rates and bar heights across major offices. By combining these approaches, we gain a multifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances statutory design, administrative practice, and actual enforcement.

177:T4e7,Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the fingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that fingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and KL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high data utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\% detection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.128:["$","section","2025-05-09",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-09","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-09"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"NCorr-FP: A Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting\n  Scheme for Intellectual Property Protection of Structured Data"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Tanja Šarčević, Andreas Rauber, Rudolf Mayer"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-09T18:53:27Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$177"}]]}]]}]]}]

178:T6ce,Abundant and diverse data on medicines manufacturing and other lifecycle components has been made easily accessible in the last decades. However, a significant proportion of this information is characterised by not being tabulated and usable for machine learning purposes. Thus, natural language processing tools have been used to build databases in domains such as biomedical and chemical to address this limitation. This has allowed the development of artificial intelligence applications, which have improved drug discovery and treatments. In the pharmaceutical manufacturing context, some initiatives and datasets for primary processing can be found, but the manufacturing of drug products is an area which is still lacking, to the best of our knowledge. This works aims to explore and adapt NLP tools used in other domains to extract information on both primary and secondary manufacturing, employing patents as the main source of data. Thus, two independent, but complementary, models were developed comprising a method to select fragments of text that contain manufacturing data, and a named entity recognition system that enables extracting information on operations, materials, and conditions of a process. For the first model, the identification of relevant sections was achieved using an unsupervised approach combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation and k-Means clustering. The performance of this model measured as a Cohen's kappa between model output and manual revision was higher than 90%. NER model consisted of a deep neural network, and an f1-score micro average of 84.2% was obtained which is comparable to other works. Some considerations for these tools to be used in data extraction are discussed throughout this document.130:["$","section","2025-05-01",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-05-01","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-05-01"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Natural Language Processing tools for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n  Information Extraction from Patents"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Diego Alvarado-Maldonado, Blair Johnston, Cameron J.

179:T4d3,Patents, which encapsulate crucial technical and legal information in text form and referenced drawings, present a rich domain for natural language processing (NLP) applications. As NLP technologies evolve, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in general text processing and generation tasks. However, the application of LLMs in the patent domain remains under-explored and under-developed due to the complexity of patents, particularly their language and legal framework. Understanding the unique characteristics of patent documents and related research in the patent domain becomes essential for researchers to apply these tools effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to equip NLP researchers with the essential knowledge to navigate this complex domain efficiently. We introduce the relevant fundamental aspects of patents to provide solid background information. In addition, we systematically break down the structural and linguistic characteristics unique to patents and map out how NLP can be leveraged for patent analysis and generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the spectrum of text-based and multimodal patent-related tasks, including nine patent analysis and four patent generation tasks.137:["$","section","2025-04-24",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-24","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-24"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Natural Language Processing in the Patent Domain: A Survey"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-03-06T23:17:16Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04105v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04105v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$179"}]]}]]}]]}]

17a:T509,Intellectual Property (IP) is a unique domain that integrates technical and legal knowledge, making it inherently complex and knowledge-intensive. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, they show great potential for processing IP tasks, enabling more efficient analysis, understanding, and generation of IP-related content. However, existing datasets and benchmarks either focus narrowly on patents or cover limited aspects of the IP field, lacking alignment with real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive IP task taxonomy and a large, diverse bilingual benchmark, IPBench, covering 8 IP mechanisms and 20 tasks. This benchmark is designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world intellectual property applications, encompassing both understanding and generation. We benchmark 16 LLMs, ranging from general-purpose to domain-specific models, and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 75.8% accuracy, revealing substantial room for improvement. Notably, open-source IP and law-oriented models lag behind closed-source general-purpose models. We publicly release all data and code of IPBench and will continue to update it with additional IP-related tasks to better reflect real-world challenges in the intellectual property domain.139:["$","section","2025-04-22",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-22","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-22"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"IPBench: Benchmarking the Knowledge of Large Language Models in\n  Intellectual Property"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Qiyao Wang, Guhong Chen, Hongbo Wang, Huaren Liu, Minghui Zhu, Zhifei Qin, Linwei Li, Yilin Yue, Shiqiang Wang, Jiayan Li, Yihang Wu, Ziqiang Liu, Longze Chen, Run Luo, Liyang Fan, Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Kan Xu, Hongfei Lin, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Shiwen Ni, Yuan Lin, Min Yang"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-22T02:00:41Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15524v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15524v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$17a"}]]}]]}]]}]
17b:T60d,Intellectual Property (IP) management involves strategically protecting and utilizing intellectual assets to enhance organizational innovation, competitiveness, and value creation. Patent matching is a crucial task in intellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and utilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents directly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and overlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of patents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent matching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from their parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their memory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing these entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph, we utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM in comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the PatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a 17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis highlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both in-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning processes of LLMs during patent matching.

17c:T42c,This article examines the proportion of technical knowledge that is eventually patented and discusses implications for innovation. Drawing from economic theory and information science, the study considers a continuum from raw data to applied understanding, while distinguishing between patentable inventions and other types of knowledge. The article explains that although the patent system is designed to incentivize the creation of economically valuable technology, only a small fraction of patentable inventions receive patent protection. Empirical evidence from surveys and historical data reveal that patenting remains an exception rather than a rule in many, but not all, industries. Furthermore, the article explores the trade-offs inherent in public disclosure requirements in patent law, which facilitate knowledge dissemination and may aid competitors. In doing so, it highlights the critical balance between rewarding inventors and preserving the free flow of knowledge, ultimately underscoring the complex role patents play in modern innovation ecosystems.13f:["$","section","2025-04-16",{"className":"mb-12","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-2","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/archive/2025-04-16","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","children":"2025-04-16"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"The Role of Patents: Incentivizing Innovation or Hindering Progress?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Gaetan de Rassenfosse"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-12-18T22:08:29Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14370v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14370v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"This article examines the complex trade-offs inherent in the patent system, exploring whether patents truly incentivize innovation or inadvertently hinder progress.

17f:T6f0,Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability. This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem, using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology. Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1) internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation, co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic, cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.156:["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$17f"}]
180:T490,Papers, patents, and clinical trials are essential scientific resources in biomedicine, crucial for knowledge sharing and dissemination. However, these documents are often stored in disparate databases with varying management standards and data formats, making it challenging to form systematic and fine-grained connections among them. To address this issue, we construct PKG 2.0, a comprehensive knowledge graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48 million clinical trials in the biomedical field. PKG 2.0 integrates these dispersed resources through 482 million biomedical entity linkages, 19 million citation linkages, and 7 million project linkages. The construction of PKG 2.0 wove together fine-grained biomedical entity extraction, high-performance author name disambiguation, multi-source citation integration, and high-quality project data from the NIH Exporter. Data validation demonstrates that PKG 2.0 excels in key tasks such as author disambiguation and biomedical entity recognition.

181:T5be,Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.171:["$","div","2",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:20:11Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$181"}]]}]
182:T58c,This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.172:["$","div","3",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-12-03T16:43:42Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$182"}]]}]
183:T4b8,Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various text generation tasks but remain under-explored in the patent domain, which offers highly structured and precise language. This paper constructs a dataset to investigate the performance of current LLMs in patent claim generation. Our results demonstrate that generating claims based on patent descriptions outperforms previous research relying on abstracts. Interestingly, current patent-specific LLMs perform much worse than state-of-the-art general LLMs, highlighting the necessity for future research on in-domain LLMs. We also find that LLMs can produce high-quality first independent claims, but their performances markedly decrease for subsequent dependent claims. Moreover, fine-tuning can enhance the completeness of inventions' features, conceptual clarity, and feature linkage. Among the tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrates the best performance in comprehensive human evaluations by patent experts, with better feature coverage, conceptual clarity, and technical coherence. Despite these capabilities, comprehensive revision and modification are still necessary to pass rigorous patent scrutiny and ensure legal robustness.173:["$","div","4",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"Can Large Language Models Generate High-quality Patent Claims?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Caiqi Zhang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-06-27T18:07:40Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$183"}]]}]

This article explores the economic and practical factors that influence whether companies seek patent protection. It discusses explicit monetary costs--such as legal fees, filing, and international expenses--and non-monetary costs related to public disclosure. Benefits include the provision of exclusion rights that secure returns and protect competitive advantages. Additionally, firms use patents as strategic tools to block rivals, strengthen bargaining positions, signal innovation quality, and attract investment. The analysis also considers alternative protection strategies like secrecy, particularly for small enterprises or industries where disclosure is detrimental."}]]}]
184:T444,Patent quality is a critical yet complex concept of interest to inventors, legal experts, and policymakers alike. This article demystifies patent quality by examining its various dimensions and definitions. It begins by discussing invention quality, emphasizing that the notion of 'technological superiority' is often too abstract to capture practical impact. The work distinguishes between incremental and radical innovations, highlighting that inventions can be evaluated by improvements over previous technologies and their economic potential. Four definitions of patent quality are explored: one based on invention quality, another linking quality with economic value, a third focusing on drafting clarity, and a fourth measuring compliance with legal standards. The article explains that high-quality patents may not necessarily protect valuable inventions and that weak patents can hold significant economic value due to legal advantages. This accessible review provides a comprehensive framework that benefits a broad audience interested in innovation policy and intellectual property.17e:["$","div","3",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-lg font-semibold mb-1","children":"What is patent quality?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Gaetan de Rassenfosse"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-04-05T21:11:04Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08785v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08785v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$184"}]]}]
