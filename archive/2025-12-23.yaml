    Scans: German Patents (1877-1918)'

  summary: We leverage multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a dataset
    of 306,070 German patents (1877-1918) from 9,562 archival image scans using our
    LLM-based pipeline powered by Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite. Our benchmarking
    exercise provides tentative evidence that multimodal LLMs can create higher quality
    datasets than our research assistants, while also being more than 795 times faster
    and 205 times cheaper in constructing the patent dataset from our image corpus.
    About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column
    format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of
    our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm
    shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our
    benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which
    can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools,
    lowering the barriers for less technical researchers. Finally, we explain the
    economics of deploying LLMs for historical dataset construction and conclude by
    speculating on the potential implications for the field of economic history.

- title: 'Owning the Intelligence: Global AI Patents Landscape and Europe''s Quest
    for Technological Sovereignty'

  summary: 'Artificial intelligence has become a key arena of global technological
    competition and a central concern for Europe''s quest for technological sovereignty.
    This paper analyzes global AI patenting from 2010 to 2023 to assess Europe''s
    position in an increasingly bipolar innovation landscape dominated by the United
    States and China. Using linked patent, firm, ownership, and citation data, we
    examine the geography, specialization, and international diffusion of AI innovation.
    We find a highly concentrated patent landscape: China leads in patent volumes,
    while the United States dominates in citation impact and technological influence.
    Europe accounts for a limited share of AI patents but exhibits signals of relatively
    high patent quality. Technological proximity reveals global convergence toward
    U.S. innovation trajectories, with Europe remaining fragmented rather than forming
    an autonomous pole. Gravity-model estimates show that cross-border AI knowledge
    flows are driven primarily by technological capability and specialization, while
    geographic and institutional factors play a secondary role. EU membership does
    not significantly enhance intra-European knowledge diffusion, suggesting that
    technological capacity, rather than political integration, underpins participation
    in global AI innovation networks.'
