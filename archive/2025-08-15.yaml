  summary: Finding relevant prior art is crucial when deciding whether to file a new
    patent application or invalidate an existing patent. However, searching for prior
    art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the need for
    nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is therefore
    invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph Transformer-based dense
    retrieval method for patent searching where each invention is represented by a
    graph describing its features and their relationships. Our model processes these
    invention graphs and is trained using prior art citations from patent office examiners
    as relevance signals. Using graphs as input significantly improves the computational
    efficiency of processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows
    the model to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching.
    The result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners
    identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available
    text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art retrieval
    quality and computational efficiency.
