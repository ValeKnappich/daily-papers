  summary: 'In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping
    innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research
    to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures
    suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity.
    Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three
    structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific
    attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13
    metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual
    text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related
    content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics.
    Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis,
    this file contains 3,511,929 most relevant paper-patent pairs, each described
    by 3 metadata fields, to facilitate the identification of potential knowledge
    flows. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders
    to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive
    temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological
    development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation
    for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.'
