  summary: 'The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO adjudicates thousands
    of ex parte appeals each year, requiring the integration of technical understanding
    and legal reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied
    in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks,
    with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured
    legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench,
    the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent
    data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks:
    Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source
    (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives,
    including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably,
    on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1
    score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance
    around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench
    establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal
    reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset
    design and model alignment. All data, code, and benchmark resources are available
    at https://github.com/TeamLab/pilot-bench.'
