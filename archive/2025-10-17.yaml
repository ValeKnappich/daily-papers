  summary: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
    green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about
    12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature.
    Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through
    vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After
    testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total
    of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity
    by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\%
    less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the
    relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts
    in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding
    at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity.
    If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that
    they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using
    text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for
    policymaking in different domains.
