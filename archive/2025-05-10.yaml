  summary: Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution
    are central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments.
    Data fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific
    marks into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP,
    a Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured
    tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method
    uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of
    fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the fingerprint
    from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness,
    fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that fingerprints are virtually
    imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and KL divergences, even at high
    embedding ratios. The system also maintains high data utility for downstream predictive
    tasks. The method achieves 100\% detection confidence under substantial data deletions
    and remains robust against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these
    requirements concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability
    of NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.
