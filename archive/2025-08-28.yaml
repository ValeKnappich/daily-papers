  summary: 'Graph-structured data, which captures non-Euclidean relationships and
    interactions between entities, is growing in scale and complexity. As a result,
    training state-of-the-art graph machine learning (GML) models have become increasingly
    resource-intensive, turning these models and data into invaluable Intellectual
    Property (IP). To address the resource-intensive nature of model training, graph-based
    Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (GMLaaS) has emerged as an efficient solution by
    leveraging third-party cloud services for model development and management. However,
    deploying such models in GMLaaS also exposes them to potential threats from attackers.
    Specifically, while the APIs within a GMLaaS system provide interfaces for users
    to query the model and receive outputs, they also allow attackers to exploit and
    steal model functionalities or sensitive training data, posing severe threats
    to the safety of these GML models and the underlying graph data. To address these
    challenges, this survey systematically introduces the first taxonomy of threats
    and defenses at the level of both GML model and graph-structured data. Such a
    tailored taxonomy facilitates an in-depth understanding of GML IP protection.
    Furthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness
    of IP protection methods, introduce a curated set of benchmark datasets across
    various domains, and discuss their application scopes and future challenges. Finally,
    we establish an open-sourced versatile library named PyGIP, which evaluates various
    attack and defense techniques in GMLaaS scenarios and facilitates the implementation
    of existing benchmark methods. The library resource can be accessed at: https://labrai.github.io/PyGIP.
    We believe this survey will play a fundamental role in intellectual property protection
    for GML and provide practical recipes for the GML community.'
