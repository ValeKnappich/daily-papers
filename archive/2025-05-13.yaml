  summary: Patent systems vary widely in how rigorously they define and enforce inventors'
    rights. On one hand, formal statutes ("law on the books") set the scope of what
    can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other hand, actual enforcement
    ("law in practice") determines whether those rights hold up in practice. To capture
    these dimensions, researchers have developed simple indices of legal provisions
    and more nuanced proxies for enforcement effectiveness, along with metrics of
    how applicant-friendly each office's procedures are. Comparative studies of "twin
    patents" -- identical inventions filed in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic
    differences in grant rates and bar heights across major offices. By combining
    these approaches, we gain a multifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances
    statutory design, administrative practice, and actual enforcement. This perspective
    is crucial for understanding how different regimes support innovation and shape
    global knowledge flows.
