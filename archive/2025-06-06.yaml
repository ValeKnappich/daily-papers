  summary: The protection of cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content
    is an increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs)
    with online retrieval capabilities enables convenient access to information but
    often undermines the rights of original content creators. As users increasingly
    rely on LLM-generated responses, they gradually diminish direct engagement with
    original information sources, which will significantly reduce the incentives for
    IP creators to contribute, and lead to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated
    content. In response, we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content
    creators to safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction
    and redistribution by leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs
    themselves. Our method follows principled motivations and effectively addresses
    an intractable black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated
    that our methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different
    LLMs, outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.
