  summary: Intellectual property (IP) rules have the potential to shape cross-border
    trade far more than their legalistic origins might suggest. Drawing on three decades
    of evidence, this review shows that stronger IP rights simultaneously create market-power
    forces that raise prices and market-expansion forces that broaden demand, while
    dynamic incentives spur quality upgrading and new export varieties. Micro-data
    and quasi-natural experiments after TRIPS reveal that IP most often boosts trade
    along the extensive margin and redirects some activity toward licensing and foreign
    investment. Policy bundling and measurement gaps on the strength of IP rights
    still cloud causal inference. Future work must map intangible flows and enforcement
    quality to capture the digital, data-driven frontier of international commerce.
