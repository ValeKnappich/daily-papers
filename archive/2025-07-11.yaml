  summary: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual
    applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored.
    We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series,
    Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying
    Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82
    accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged
    at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two
    are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design.
    None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy
    never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards
    -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and
    bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and
    graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts
    evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings
    of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness
    of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert
    judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt
    wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future
    work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting
    to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding
    performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their
    performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney.
    This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.
