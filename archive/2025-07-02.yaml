  summary: 'Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product
    ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge. This
    work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to
    mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work, we design
    Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based business
    ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and agent-based architectures
    across three domains: Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, and Material
    Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the agentic approach consistently outperformed
    standalone LLMs in terms of idea quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings
    suggest that combining LLMs with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the
    innovation pipeline by unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation
    from patent data.'
