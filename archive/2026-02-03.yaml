  summary: The present paper examines the effect of R&D spillovers on regional innovation
    in Greece over the 2002-2010 period. The approach taken goes beyond a regional
    knowledge production function and draws possible explanations from a more extensive
    pool of R&D related and regional structural variables. Having employed game theory
    techniques in order to describe the licensing of the patents through royalties
    and derived the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium under a Stackelberg duopoly,
    the results obtained accord with findings of previous studies when it comes R&D
    expenditure related variables and further suggest that the role of highly-qualified
    employment is instrumental in promoting regional innovation. The results also
    suggest the benefits of synergies between R&D personnel in manufacturing and other
    measures of highly-qualified employment as well as R&D expenditure of the public
    sector and employment in manufacturing business R&D for regional innovation.
