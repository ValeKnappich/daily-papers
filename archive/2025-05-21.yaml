  summary: Scientific knowledge is a key driver of technological innovation, shaping
    industrial development and policy decisions worldwide. Understanding how patents
    incorporate scientific research is essential for assessing the role of academic
    discoveries in technological progress. Non-Patent References (NPRs) provide a
    useful indicator of this relationship by revealing the extent to which patents
    draw upon scientific literature. Here, we show that reliance on scientific research
    in patents varies significantly across regions. Oceania and Europe display stronger
    engagement with scientific knowledge, while the Americas exhibit lower reliance.
    Moreover, NPRs are more likely to be open access than the average scientific publication,
    a trend that intensifies when Sci-Hub availability is considered. These results
    highlight the transformative impact of Open Science on global innovation dynamics.
    By facilitating broader access to research, Open Science strengthens the link
    between academia and industry, underscoring the need for policies that promote
    equitable and science-based innovation, particularly in developing regions.
