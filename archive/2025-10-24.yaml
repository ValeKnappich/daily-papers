  summary: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
    and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual Property
    (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation, there is
    no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of continuous-time
    or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking attacks. We propose an
    approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU with enhanced cybersecurity
    and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the connection is initiated by the
    client and the models and binaries live on trusted platforms. We showcase the
    functionality of this approach using two co-simulation demos in four different
    network settings and analyze the trade-off between IP-protected distribution and
    performance efficiency in these settings.
