  summary: High-stakes texts such as patent claims, medical records, and technical
    reports are structurally complex and demand a high degree of reliability and precision.
    While large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to automate their
    generation in high-stakes domains, reliably evaluating such outputs remains a
    major challenge. Conventional natural language generation (NLG) metrics are effective
    for generic documents but fail to capture the structural and legal characteristics
    essential to evaluating complex high-stakes documents. To address this gap, we
    propose PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework specifically designed
    for one of the most intricate and rigorous domains, patent claims. PatentScore
    integrates hierarchical decomposition of claim elements, validation patterns grounded
    in legal and technical standards, and scoring across structural, semantic, and
    legal dimensions. In experiments on our dataset which consists of 400 Claim1,
    PatentScore achieved the highest correlation with expert annotations ($r = 0.819$),
    significantly outperforming widely used NLG metrics. This work establishes a new
    standard for evaluating LLM-generated patent claims, providing a solid foundation
    for research on patent generation and validation.
