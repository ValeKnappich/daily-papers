  summary: Pretraining on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great power in facilitating
    various downstream tasks. As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data
    and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties
    (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy
    the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have
    been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require
    the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to
    self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel
    framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection
    while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a
    task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN
    encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed. Theoretical
    analysis and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of {\method} in IP protection
    and maintaining high-performance for downstream tasks.
