  summary: Abundant and diverse data on medicines manufacturing and other lifecycle
    components has been made easily accessible in the last decades. However, a significant
    proportion of this information is characterised by not being tabulated and usable
    for machine learning purposes. Thus, natural language processing tools have been
    used to build databases in domains such as biomedical and chemical to address
    this limitation. This has allowed the development of artificial intelligence applications,
    which have improved drug discovery and treatments. In the pharmaceutical manufacturing
    context, some initiatives and datasets for primary processing can be found, but
    the manufacturing of drug products is an area which is still lacking, to the best
    of our knowledge. This works aims to explore and adapt NLP tools used in other
    domains to extract information on both primary and secondary manufacturing, employing
    patents as the main source of data. Thus, two independent, but complementary,
    models were developed comprising a method to select fragments of text that contain
    manufacturing data, and a named entity recognition system that enables extracting
    information on operations, materials, and conditions of a process. For the first
    model, the identification of relevant sections was achieved using an unsupervised
    approach combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation and k-Means clustering. The performance
    of this model measured as a Cohen's kappa between model output and manual revision
    was higher than 90%. NER model consisted of a deep neural network, and an f1-score
    micro average of 84.2% was obtained which is comparable to other works. Some considerations
    for these tools to be used in data extraction are discussed throughout this document.
