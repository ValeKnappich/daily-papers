  summary: Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of
    long text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text
    semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that integrates
    Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention Network (M-GAT)
    and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a dynamic mask, contrast
    and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word, sentence and paragraph
    hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints
    are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL to strengthen the local
    semantic and global thematic consistency of patent text; M-GAT models patent classification
    codes, citation relations and text semantics as heterogeneous graph structures,
    and achieves dynamic fusion of multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention;
    MSA adopts a hierarchical sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency
    of long text modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments
    show that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep
    learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity matching,
    and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and practical value for
    solving the problems of patent examination efficiency improvement and technology
    relevance mining.
