12:T585,Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word, sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency improvement and technology relevance mining.13:T493,Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into three core dimensions: technical feature, application domain, and claim scope, to compute dimension-specific similarity scores. These scores are dynamically weighted through a four-stage reasoning process which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct PatentSimBench, a human-annotated benchmark comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that PatentMind achieves a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models and advanced prompt engineering methods.These results highlight the effectiveness of modular reasoning frameworks in overcoming key limitations of embedding-based methods for analyzing patent similarity.7:["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-6xl mx-auto py-10 px-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-extrabold mb-8 tracking-tight text-center","children":["Papers for ","2025-05-26"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900 mb-8","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":"Research on feature fusion and multimodal patent text based on graph\n  attention network"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Zhenzhen Song, Ziwei Liu, Hongji Li"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-26T16:32:43Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$12"}]]}],["$","div","1",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentMind: A Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph for Patent Similarity\n  Evaluation"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:28:27Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19347v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$13"}]]}],"$L14","$L15","$L16"]}],"$L17"]}]
18:T5be,Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity, technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic, and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and generalizability of our framework.14:["$","div","2",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":"PatentScore: Multi-dimensional Evaluation of LLM-Generated Patent Claims"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2025-05-25T22:20:11Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19345v1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$18"}]]}]
19:T58c,This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.15:["$","div","3",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":"Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-12-03T16:43:42Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02549v2"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$19"}]]}]
1a:T4b8,Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various text generation tasks but remain under-explored in the patent domain, which offers highly structured and precise language. This paper constructs a dataset to investigate the performance of current LLMs in patent claim generation. Our results demonstrate that generating claims based on patent descriptions outperforms previous research relying on abstracts. Interestingly, current patent-specific LLMs perform much worse than state-of-the-art general LLMs, highlighting the necessity for future research on in-domain LLMs. We also find that LLMs can produce high-quality first independent claims, but their performances markedly decrease for subsequent dependent claims. Moreover, fine-tuning can enhance the completeness of inventions' features, conceptual clarity, and feature linkage. Among the tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrates the best performance in comprehensive human evaluations by patent experts, with better feature coverage, conceptual clarity, and technical coherence. Despite these capabilities, comprehensive revision and modification are still necessary to pass rigorous patent scrutiny and ensure legal robustness.16:["$","div","4",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":"Can Large Language Models Generate High-quality Patent Claims?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Authors:"}]," ","Lekang Jiang, Caiqi Zhang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-1","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Published:"}]," ","2024-06-27T18:07:40Z"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2","children":[["$","b",null,{"children":"Link:"}]," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3","className":"text-blue-600 hover:underline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","children":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v3"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"whitespace-pre-line","children":"$1a"}]]}]
