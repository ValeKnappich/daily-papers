  summary: Non Fungible Tokens have changed digital ownership and how creators earn
    money. Between 2021 and 2024, the market value exceeded 40 billion. However, the
    fast growth of the NFT ecosystem has revealed serious issues in managing intellectual
    property rights. There is a lot of confusion about the difference between owning
    an NFT and owning the copyright for the underlying content. This research looks
    at the gap between traditional copyright laws and blockchain-based transactions.
    We use a mixed methods approach to analyze this disconnect. We create a new IP
    rights matrix that clearly shows how copyright law relates to NFT ownership structures.
    Additionally, we include a business model taxonomy that sorts new commercial applications
    by their IP risk and sustainability factors. By examining important legal cases,
    smart contracts, and interviews with stakeholders, we find key problems in enforcing
    laws across different regions, standardizing licenses, and assessing business
    opportunities.
