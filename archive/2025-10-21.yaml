  summary: This review systematically analyzes patent disclosures regarding plasmonic
    structures, devices, and integrated applications, highlighting the technology's
    capability to confine and manipulate electromagnetic energy at the nanoscale.
    Core materials rely on highly conductive noble metals (Gold, Silver), alongside
    innovative alternatives like Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs), Graphene, and
    2D materials. These materials are engineered into diverse nanostructures that
    exploit Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance
    (LSPR). LSPR generates intense electromagnetic "hot spots" necessary for signal
    amplification (SERS) and provides extreme refractive index sensitivity for label-free
    detection. Key device elements include subwavelength plasmonic waveguides (hybrid
    and slot types) for optical signal routing. Dynamic control is achieved through
    active tuning mechanisms, utilizing electrical gating of charge carrier density
    (e.g., TCOs, Graphene) and solid-state phase change materials (e.g., VO2).
