  summary: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into
    not only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage
    containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation. This
    chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science, by
    focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as fundamentally
    tied to the global movement of scientific and technological knowledge. With a
    focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents, and international
    competition with patents, this work considers how new technologies are challenging
    traditional notions of inventorship, access, and moral accountability.The chapter
    provides a critical analysis of AI's implications for patent authorship and prior
    art searches, ownership issues arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology
    to ethical dilemmas, and the problem of using patents for strategic advantage
    in a global context of innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified
    the importance of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality,
    implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical contemplation
    about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems. Ultimately, the
    chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and ethically-based approach
    in managing knowledge in the patenting environment highlighting the role for information
    professionals and policy to contribute to access equity in innovation.
