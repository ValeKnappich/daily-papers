  summary: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for
    Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting
    expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the
    description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic
    generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys
    typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering
    research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers
    serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic
    benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing
    the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task,
    we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention
    specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show
    that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle
    to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style
    language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.

    \ Patent Claims"

  summary: Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there
    are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this
    is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most
    frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic
    methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting
    and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to
    date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel
    dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language
    Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC
    using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the
    USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness.
    A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality
    annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement
    an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited
    reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen
    2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness
    prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons.
    PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the
    development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset
    and code.

  summary: Papers, patents, and clinical trials are essential scientific resources
    in biomedicine, crucial for knowledge sharing and dissemination. However, these
    documents are often stored in disparate databases with varying management standards
    and data formats, making it challenging to form systematic and fine-grained connections
    among them. To address this issue, we construct PKG 2.0, a comprehensive knowledge
    graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48
    million clinical trials in the biomedical field. PKG 2.0 integrates these dispersed
    resources through 482 million biomedical entity linkages, 19 million citation
    linkages, and 7 million project linkages. The construction of PKG 2.0 wove together
    fine-grained biomedical entity extraction, high-performance author name disambiguation,
    multi-source citation integration, and high-quality project data from the NIH
    Exporter. Data validation demonstrates that PKG 2.0 excels in key tasks such as
    author disambiguation and biomedical entity recognition. This dataset provides
    valuable resources for biomedical researchers, bibliometric scholars, and those
    engaged in literature mining.
