  summary: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform
    that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology scouting
    and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to solving complex
    research and development challenges are often time consuming, manually driven,
    and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These methods typically involve
    navigating fragmented sources such as patent repositories, commercial product
    catalogs, and competitor data, leading to inefficiencies and incomplete insights.
    The proposed platform utilizes cutting edge LLM capabilities including semantic
    understanding, contextual reasoning, and cross-domain knowledge extraction to
    interpret problem statements and retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions.
    The system processes unstructured patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions,
    and systematically extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem
    context. These solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized
    technical categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
    interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform integrates
    commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions and active organizations
    addressing similar challenges. This combined insight sourced from both intellectual
    property and real world product data enables R&D teams to assess not only technical
    novelty but also feasibility, scalability, and sustainability. The result is a
    comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine that reduces manual effort, accelerates
    innovation cycles, and enhances decision making in complex R&D environments.
