  summary: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
    innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and
    retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval,
    patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies
    and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation.
    Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined
    by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories
    (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into
    specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive
    contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in
    the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
    image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
    taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
    on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval
    results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require
    fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited
    hardware.
