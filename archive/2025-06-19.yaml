  summary: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
    innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and
    retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval,
    patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies
    and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation.
    Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined
    by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories
    (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into
    specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive
    contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in
    the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
    image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
    taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
    on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval
    results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require
    fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited
    hardware.

  summary: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for
    Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting
    expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the
    description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic
    generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys
    typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering
    research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers
    serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic
    benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing
    the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task,
    we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention
    specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show
    that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle
    to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style
    language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.
