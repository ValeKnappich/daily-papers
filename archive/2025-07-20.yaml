  summary: Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the
    originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent
    data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing
    need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the
    desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach
    that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability
    of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge
    to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information
    in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation.
    From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving
    a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete
    recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results,
    a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining
    100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing
    precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were
    conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1]
    and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100%
    recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five
    test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50%
    for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth,
    and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked,
    thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing
    potential legal risks.
