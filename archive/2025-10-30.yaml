  summary: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools,
    systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research
    attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory
    compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules,
    and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework
    is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated
    patents from two patent drafting tools. Experimental results show balanced accuracies
    of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\% respectively across the three detection modules
    when validated against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to
    examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring
    sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical
    detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction
    show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation
    requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored
    ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like
    typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment
    and cross-references.
