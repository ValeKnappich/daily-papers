  summary: Patent novelty search systems are critical to IP protection and innovation
    assessment; their retrieval accuracy directly impacts patent quality. We propose
    a comprehensive evaluation methodology that builds high-quality, reproducible
    datasets from examiner citations and X-type citations extracted from technically
    consistent family patents, and evaluates systems using invention descriptions
    as inputs. Using Top-k Detection Rate and Recall as core metrics, we further conduct
    multi-dimensional analyses by language, technical field (IPC), and filing jurisdiction.
    Experiments show the method effectively exposes performance differences across
    scenarios and offers actionable evidence for system improvement. The framework
    is scalable and practical, providing a useful reference for development and optimization
    of patent novelty search systems
