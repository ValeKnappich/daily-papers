  summary: 'Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels
    of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents
    one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a
    huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which offers
    little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose Reasoning
    for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that reformulates HTC
    as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce hierarchical labels. RHC
    trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a cold-start stage that aligns
    outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning format and a reinforcement learning
    (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages
    in our experiments. (1) Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms
    the supervised fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro
    F1. (2) Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction
    to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with model
    size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4) Applicability: Beyond
    patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves state-of-the-art performance
    on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which highlights its broad applicability.'
