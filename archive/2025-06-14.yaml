  summary: Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis
    and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations.
    The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning
    has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types
    of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the
    labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal
    intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier
    than archetypal documents, which complicates the process of extracting pertinent
    information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization
    methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently
    creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging
    the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input
    parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART)
    model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing
    text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies.
    Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain
    Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.
