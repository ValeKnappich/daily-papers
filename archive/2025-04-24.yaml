  summary: Patents, which encapsulate crucial technical and legal information in text
    form and referenced drawings, present a rich domain for natural language processing
    (NLP) applications. As NLP technologies evolve, large language models (LLMs) have
    demonstrated outstanding capabilities in general text processing and generation
    tasks. However, the application of LLMs in the patent domain remains under-explored
    and under-developed due to the complexity of patents, particularly their language
    and legal framework. Understanding the unique characteristics of patent documents
    and related research in the patent domain becomes essential for researchers to
    apply these tools effectively. Therefore, this paper aims to equip NLP researchers
    with the essential knowledge to navigate this complex domain efficiently. We introduce
    the relevant fundamental aspects of patents to provide solid background information.
    In addition, we systematically break down the structural and linguistic characteristics
    unique to patents and map out how NLP can be leveraged for patent analysis and
    generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the spectrum of text-based and multimodal
    patent-related tasks, including nine patent analysis and four patent generation
    tasks.
