  summary: This article reviews the empirical evidence on the use of patent citations
    as a proxy for invention importance. It distinguishes between technical merit,
    private economic value, and social value, and surveys validation studies using
    expert ratings, market data, renewal records, and compensation reports. The findings
    confirm that while the count of citations is positively associated with various
    dimensions of value, it remains a noisy indicator -- correlated but far from definitive.
