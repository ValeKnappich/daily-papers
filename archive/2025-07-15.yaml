  summary: As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need
    to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification
    is challenging due to the independent and inherently complex nature of technologies.
    Traditionally, regional analyses of technological portfolios have been limited
    to binary evaluations, indicating merely whether a region specializes in a technology,
    or relying on the average Technological Complexity Index (TCI) of the specialized
    technologies. This study proposes that evaluating TCI at the corporate level could
    provide finer granularity and more detailed insights. To address the underutilization
    of corporate-level TCI assessments in Japan, this study applies the Technological
    Complexity Index using carefully processed patent data spanning fiscal years 1981
    to 2010. Specifically, we analyze a bipartite network composed of 1,938 corporations
    connected to technological fields categorized into either 35 or 124 classifications.
    Our findings quantitatively characterize the ubiquity and sophistication of each
    technological field, reveal detailed technological trends reflecting broader societal
    contexts, and demonstrate methodological stability even when employing finer technological
    classifications. Additionally, our corporate-level approach allows consistent
    comparisons across different regions and technological fields, clarifying regional
    advantages in specific technologies. This refined analytical framework offers
    policymakers and researchers robust, targeted insights, thereby significantly
    contributing to innovation strategy formulation in Japan.
