  summary: Effective query formulation is a key challenge in long-document Information
    Retrieval (IR). This challenge is particularly acute in domain-specific contexts
    like patent retrieval, where documents are lengthy, linguistically complex, and
    encompass multiple interrelated technical topics. In this work, we present the
    application of recent extractive and abstractive summarization methods for generating
    concise, purpose-specific summaries of patent documents. We further assess the
    utility of these automatically generated summaries as surrogate queries across
    three benchmark patent datasets and compare their retrieval performance against
    conventional approaches that use entire patent sections. Experimental results
    show that summarization-based queries significantly improve prior-art retrieval
    effectiveness, highlighting their potential as an efficient alternative to traditional
    query formulation techniques.
