  summary: 'Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional
    skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to
    assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied
    on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To enlarge
    research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions, and legal
    standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents rich textual
    data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related tasks, including
    claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three critical aspects: (1)
    Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices vary in legal and drafting
    conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a benchmark for European patents
    to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2) Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality
    granted patents with finalized and legally approved texts, whereas others consist
    of patent applications that are unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that
    LLMs fine-tuned on EPD significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets
    and even GPT-4o in claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world
    simulation: We propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world
    challenges of claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially
    worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future research.'
