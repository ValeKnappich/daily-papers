- title: 'The Role of Patents: Incentivizing Innovation or Hindering Progress?'
  authors:
  - Gaetan de Rassenfosse
  summary: This article examines the complex trade-offs inherent in the patent system,
    exploring whether patents truly incentivize innovation or inadvertently hinder
    progress. It traces the historical evolution of patent rights from their origins
    in Renaissance Venice to the modern framework enshrined in constitutional and
    international law. By balancing the exclusivity granted to inventors with the
    need for public access to knowledge, the article highlights how patents stimulate
    R&D investments while sometimes limiting follow-on innovation due to prolonged
    monopolies. It discusses the economic rationales for patent protection, such as
    increasing private returns to encourage invention, against criticisms that patents
    restrict the free flow of ideas essential for collective progress. Ultimately,
    the review argues that although patents are designed to reward creativity and
    secure economic benefits, they remain a contentious instrument whose benefits
    and limitations must be carefully weighed in policy debates.

- title: What Proportion of Knowledge is Patented?
  authors:
  - Gaetan de Rassenfosse
  summary: This article examines the proportion of technical knowledge that is eventually
    patented and discusses implications for innovation. Drawing from economic theory
    and information science, the study considers a continuum from raw data to applied
    understanding, while distinguishing between patentable inventions and other types
    of knowledge. The article explains that although the patent system is designed
    to incentivize the creation of economically valuable technology, only a small
    fraction of patentable inventions receive patent protection. Empirical evidence
    from surveys and historical data reveal that patenting remains an exception rather
    than a rule in many, but not all, industries. Furthermore, the article explores
    the trade-offs inherent in public disclosure requirements in patent law, which
    facilitate knowledge dissemination and may aid competitors. In doing so, it highlights
    the critical balance between rewarding inventors and preserving the free flow
    of knowledge, ultimately underscoring the complex role patents play in modern
    innovation ecosystems.

- title: Why do firms patent?
  authors:
  - Gaetan de Rassenfosse
  summary: Firms' decisions to patent innovations involve a complex evaluation of
    costs, benefits, and strategic considerations. This article explores the economic
    and practical factors that influence whether companies seek patent protection.
    It discusses explicit monetary costs--such as legal fees, filing, and international
    expenses--and non-monetary costs related to public disclosure. Benefits include
    the provision of exclusion rights that secure returns and protect competitive
    advantages. Additionally, firms use patents as strategic tools to block rivals,
    strengthen bargaining positions, signal innovation quality, and attract investment.
    The analysis also considers alternative protection strategies like secrecy, particularly
    for small enterprises or industries where disclosure is detrimental.

- title: What is patent quality?
  authors:
  - Gaetan de Rassenfosse
  summary: 'Patent quality is a critical yet complex concept of interest to inventors,
    legal experts, and policymakers alike. This article demystifies patent quality
    by examining its various dimensions and definitions. It begins by discussing invention
    quality, emphasizing that the notion of ''technological superiority'' is often
    too abstract to capture practical impact. The work distinguishes between incremental
    and radical innovations, highlighting that inventions can be evaluated by improvements
    over previous technologies and their economic potential. Four definitions of patent
    quality are explored: one based on invention quality, another linking quality
    with economic value, a third focusing on drafting clarity, and a fourth measuring
    compliance with legal standards. The article explains that high-quality patents
    may not necessarily protect valuable inventions and that weak patents can hold
    significant economic value due to legal advantages. This accessible review provides
    a comprehensive framework that benefits a broad audience interested in innovation
    policy and intellectual property.'
