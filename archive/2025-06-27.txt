11:T60c,In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level. The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336 full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments (forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional, requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now the access link is this repository: https://osf.io/vbyzd/?view_only=1a40242e0d1941a58aa854af3e50cf6b).12:T428,Recent advances in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative capabilities across diverse domains. The field of patent analysis and innovation is not an exception, where natural language processing (NLP) techniques presents opportunities to streamline and enhance important tasks -- such as patent classification and patent retrieval -- in the patent cycle. This not only accelerates the efficiency of patent researchers and applicants, but also opens new avenues for technological innovation and discovery. Our survey provides a comprehensive summary of recent NLP-based methods -- including multimodal ones -- in patent analysis. We also introduce a novel taxonomy for categorization based on tasks in the patent life cycle, as well as the specifics of the methods. This interdisciplinary survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners who work at the intersection of NLP, Multimodal AI, and patent analysis, as well as patent offices to build efficient patent systems.6:["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-6xl mx-auto py-10 px-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-extrabold mb-8 tracking-tight text-center","children":["Papers for ","2025-06-27"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert border rounded p-4 bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900 mb-8","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mb-1","children":[1,".
