  summary: 'Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
    for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture,
    where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While
    effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet
    underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property
    (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for
    IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints.
    Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing
    behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level
    fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint
    (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference
    Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates
    each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight
    to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based
    matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference
    (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE
    architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused
    experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust
    against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and
    parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight-
    and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as
    a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based
    model merging.'
