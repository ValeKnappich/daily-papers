  summary: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about
    intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based
    fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible
    to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage
    and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting}
    (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific
    stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct,
    and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving
    downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers,
    remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust
    to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a
    practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and
    intellectual property protection.
