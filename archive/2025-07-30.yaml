  summary: 'Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches
    in several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing
    by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work,
    we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating
    LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate
    six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning
    zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the
    abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation:
    we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics
    -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three
    types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification
    and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability,
    and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity
    and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
    baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
    future research.'
